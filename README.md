## Usage

Using the Tug SEO Bundle in your Symfony application is straightforward. Here are the basic steps:

1. Define SEO fields: Use the provided services to define SEO fields for your application, such as titles, descriptions, and keywords.
2. Configure translations: If your application serves content in multiple languages, configure translations for SEO fields.
3. Render SEO metadata: In your templates, use the Twig extension to render SEO metadata for the current route.
4. Customize rendering: Customize the rendering of SEO metadata according to your needs, such as adding Open Graph tags or Twitter Card tags.
5. Extend functionality: If necessary, extend the bundle's functionality by adding custom SEO fields or renderers.

## Registering Services (Optional)

While the Tug SEO Bundle provides a comprehensive set of services out of the box, you have the option to register only 
the services you need for your specific use case. Registering services is an opt-in feature for users who want to 
customize or use specific parts of the bundle code. See the [Registering Services](#registering-services-optional) 
section below for more details.

### Define your own field type

Write your definition code for custom field.
```php
namespace App\MyProject\Field;

use Tug\SeoBundle\Field\{FieldData, FieldInterface};
use Tug\SeoBundle\Model\Meta as MetaModel;

class Robot implements FieldInterface
{
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function getNamespace(): array
    {
        return ['my', 'robot'];
    }

    public function buildModels(FieldData $fieldData): iterable
    {
        $meta = new MetaModel();
        
        $meta->setName('robot');
        $meta->setContent($fieldData->getContent());
        
        yield $meta;
    }
}
```

Enable it on service configuration for autowiring.
```yaml
services:
  App\MyProject\Field\Robot: ~
```

Configure it on your `tug_seo.yaml` file.
```yaml
tug_seo:
  routes:
    my_special_route:
      my:
        robot: noindex, nofollow
```

You will see the code below on your generated html.
```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```
